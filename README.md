# modpack-release

a working set of modules under a single version. aka a "modpack".

use [terraform-modpack-dev](https://github.com/briceburg/terraform-modpack-dev) to develop these modules.

## philosophy

Infra should be basic and intuitive. Not overly flexible.

* Get rid of knobs. Design for reuse.
* Provide discoverable conventions.

If something needs customization, it should stand out.
